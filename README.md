My iOS app provides a guided approach to learning fundamental drawing techniques using visual cues. Users can select an image to project through the camera with adjustable opacity, allowing them to trace over the drawing effectively.

### App Features

**Home Page:**
- Users can select an image by either taking a new picture with their camera or choosing an existing photo from their library.
- Once the image is selected, it is displayed on the Home Page for the user's review.
- Users can confirm their selection by clicking the check mark button, which takes them to the Next Page.

**Next Page:**
- The Next Page features an AR View Container that projects the camera's live feed onto the phone screen, with the selected image overlaid on top.
- Users can edit the image by scaling, moving, or adjusting its opacity through the edit button.
- Once satisfied with the adjustments, users can save their changes by pressing the check mark button or reset their edits with the cancel button.

### Conclusion

My app empowers users to improve their drawing skills by providing an intuitive way to trace images with adjustable opacity. This method makes it easier for users to learn and practice fundamental drawing techniques. In the future, I plan to introduce additional features, such as a library of pre-selected images for tracing, advanced editing tools, and a community platform for users to share their drawings and receive feedback. By continuously enhancing the app, I aim to support users on their artistic journey and help them develop their skills further.
